Problem Statement: Predicting Loan Outcomes

Background: A financial institution processes loan applications from various customers. These applications can result in either “good” loans (successfully repaid) or “bad” loans (defaults or charge-offs). The institution wants to improve its loan approval process by predicting the likelihood of loan outcomes.

Objective: Develop a predictive model that can accurately classify loan applications as either “good” or “bad” based on relevant features.

Data: The dataset includes historical loan applications with the following features:

Loan amount
Purpose (e.g., auto, personal, project)
Grade (e.g., A1, B1, C1)
Interest rate
Term (loan duration)
Verification status
Home ownership
Employment length
